Hi Balu,

My friend & I came up with an idea for software/hardware package that could improve workflow and reduce likelihood of errors in ophthalmology field.

Let me know if you have a few minutes to discuss potential cooperation.  I think you experience in the healthcare field could be extremely useful to us.

Regards,



Pavel

Itineraries

http://horizonyachtcharters.com/bvi/itineraries/

Day 1
A short reach across the Sir Francis Drake Channel arrive at The Bight, Norman Island, rumored to be the site of Robert Louis Stevenson’s famous novel, “Treasure Island”. There’s time for a swim or snorkel at the Indians before watching a spectacular Caribbean sunset while enjoying a sundowner. Visit either the Pirates Bight ashore, or the floating bar/restaurant the William Thornton – each serving great food and offering the utmost in casual dining.

Day 2
After breakfast, take your dinghy over (or the yacht) to The Caves. Pick up a National Park buoy and enjoy the wonders of the coral reef and its colourful inhabitants (don’t forget to look for treasure!). Sail to Cooper Island and arrive early enough to pick up an overnight mooring buoy (no anchoring here please). Time for more snorkeling off Cistern Point, or while away the afternoon lounging on the beach.

Day 3
Sail to The Baths (get there early) and pick up a buoy – plan to spend the morning here and have lunch. Dinghy ashore and explore the magnificent boulders and rock pools created by Mother Nature millions of years ago. This has got to be one of the most beautiful places on Earth. After lunch, sail to Trellis Bay to spend the night – there are many places to go ashore or plan to BBQ on board your yacht. Trellis Bay has full moon parties every month – not to be missed! You can also visit the home of the Caribbean Arts & Crafts Festival, Aragorn’s Studio, and pick up some superb local arts and crafts.

Day 4
Off to North Sound, Virgin Gorda (great snorkeling at the Dogs or Mountain Point en route) – the hard part being which anchorage to choose for your overnight stay. If you want entertainment, Bitter End Yacht Club offers music most nights – here you can re-provision your boat, visit the shops, rent a Hobie Cat, learn to windsurf , … there is lots to do. Leverick Bay has a marina facility also and a good restaurant. You can also take in many of the mega yachts that visit Yacht Club Costa Smeralda…

Biras Creek is for those seeking elegance and first-class service – the resort has one of the best restaurants and wine cellars in the BVI (there is a dress code after 7pm).

Day 5
We at Horizon Yacht Charters know this area better than most and will let you into some of its secrets. Spend the morning exploring by dinghy – there are many beautiful, deserted beaches and Eustatia Reef is a wonderful snorkeling site, or set sail for Monkey Point on Guana Island in time for lunch and some snorkeling. Cruise down the rugged and unspoilt North shore of Tortola and overnight in either Little Harbour or Great Harbour, Jost Van Dyke. Good place to sample the local lobster!

Day 6
Sail or motor over to Sandy Cay – the perfect desert island! Snorkel, swim and beachcomb then enjoy lunch before you sail to Cane Garden Bay for your overnight stop. Enjoy a great BBQ chicken and ribs dinner at Quito’s and then dance ’till the early hours!

Day 7
After playing on the beach at Cane Garden Bay, set sail for Soper’s Hole, West End or enjoy a longer sail to Little Harbour, Peter Island. As you watch the sunset, promise yourself you will be back soon to visit the many other wonderful places in the BVI that you didn’t get to see this time.

Day 8
Time for one more swim then back to Nanny Cay Marina and Horizon Yacht Charters, making sure you have enough time to complete the check-in procedure at our dock. Your flights will be reconfirmed, your taxi already booked and soon you’ll be on your way home, already planning your return!

Diving the British Virgin Islands
Some of the best diving in the world is here in the British Virgin Islands, including the Wreck of the RMS Rhone, rated as one of the top ten wreck dives in the world. Mention that you will be diving before your chart briefing and we will cover the dive sites as well with you.

Our office is located right next door to Blue Water Divers where you can rent Scuba equipment or organise “rendezvous” dives, where the dive boat will meet your yacht at anchor and pick up those wishing to dive (a perfect solution if only some of the crew want to dive). They supply tank racks so you can safely store tanks on the yacht. There are refill stations around the islands.
